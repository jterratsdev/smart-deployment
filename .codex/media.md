# Media Cloud Standards

> Role: Media Cloud Developer / Consultant — Salesforce Professional Services.
> Media Cloud is a Salesforce industry solution for media companies. All standards here apply **in addition to** general Apex and LWC rules.

## Consultative Design (CRITICAL)
- **No Ninja Edits.** Always summarize proposed changes and get explicit agreement before modifying any file.
- Provide pros/cons for Media Cloud data model and configuration decisions before implementing.

## Native Configuration Before Custom Objects (CRITICAL)
- **Before proposing any custom object or custom solution, check whether the target product already
  provides a native configuration that covers the requirement.**
- This prevents shadow objects that duplicate platform-managed records, break native reporting,
  and complicate upgrades.

### Configuration Types to Verify by Product

| Requirement Area | Native Configuration to Check First | Product Admin Guide |

| Entitlement processes | Entitlement Process, Milestone Actions | https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.entitlements_process_overview.htm |

### Evaluation Protocol
1. Identify the business requirement.
2. Ask: *"Does Salesforce have a native configuration, object, or setup page that manages this?"*
3. If yes: propose configuring the native feature. Document the configuration spec in `/docs/`.
4. If native configuration is insufficient: document *why* in an ADR before proposing custom metadata.
5. Partial native coverage: configure native as far as it goes, extend with custom metadata only for the gap.

### Red Flags — Proposals That Usually Duplicate Native Features
- Custom `SLA__c` object when Entitlements + Milestones already model SLAs.
- Custom approval object when Approval Processes handle multi-step approvals natively.
- Custom milestone object when Case Milestones track time-based KPIs on cases.
- Custom routing table when Omni-Channel routing configurations already exist.
- Custom `KnowledgeArticle__c` object when Salesforce Knowledge article types are available.
- Custom scheduling object when FSL Work Orders and Service Appointments cover scheduling.

**When reviewing any story or ADR that introduces a new object: run this checklist before signing off.**

## Media Cloud Data Model (CRITICAL)
- **Media Cloud covers four core domains:** Ad Sales, Subscription Management, Content Distribution, and Audience Segmentation.
- **Never create custom objects that duplicate standard Media Cloud objects.** The managed data model is the system of record for media operations.
- **Always check existing Media Cloud configuration** before proposing custom metadata or objects.

### Core Media Cloud Objects
| Object | API Name | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Media Channel | `MediaChannel` | Distribution channels (TV, digital, print, radio, OTT) |
| Media Plan | `MediaPlan` | Campaign media plans linking advertisers to inventory |
| Ad Space | `AdSpace` | Available advertising inventory units |
| Ad Space Specification | `AdSpaceSpecification` | Technical specs for ad placements (dimensions, format, duration) |
| Subscription Plan | `SubscriptionPlan` | Subscriber plan definitions (tiers, pricing, entitlements) |
| Subscriber Profile | `SubscriberProfile` | Individual subscriber records with lifecycle state |
| Content Distribution | `ContentDistribution` | Content scheduling and distribution across channels |
| Ad Server Integration | `AdServerIntegration` | External ad server connection configuration |

## Ad Sales
- **Media Plan creation:** Always associate media plans with an Account (advertiser) and Campaign.
  A media plan contains one or more ad space allocations with date ranges, CPM/CPP rates, and impressions targets.
- **Ad Space inventory:** Model available inventory as `AdSpace` records linked to `MediaChannel`.
  Each ad space has specifications (`AdSpaceSpecification`) defining format, dimensions, duration, and placement rules.
- **Proposal generation:** Use Industries CPQ for media proposals.
  Generate proposals from media plans with rate card pricing, package discounts, and value-added placements.
- **Campaign management:** Link media plans to standard Campaign records for ROI tracking.
  Track delivery (impressions served, clicks, conversions) against plan targets.
- **Rate cards:** Configure rate cards per channel, daypart, and audience segment.
  Rate cards drive automatic pricing in proposal generation — never hardcode rates in Apex.

## Subscription Management
- **Plan configuration:** Define subscription plans with tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium),
  billing frequencies (monthly, annual), and feature entitlements per tier.
- **Subscriber lifecycle:** Model the complete lifecycle: Trial → Active → Suspended → Churned.
  Use Record-Triggered Flows for state transitions — never trigger logic directly on managed objects.
- **Entitlements:** Link subscription plans to content entitlements.
  Subscribers access content based on their active plan tier and add-on purchases.
- **Billing integration:** Integrate with billing systems via Platform Events or Named Credential callouts.
  Never store payment card data in Salesforce — use tokenized references only.

## Audience Management
- **Segment definition:** Define audience segments based on demographics, viewing behavior, and content preferences.
  Segments drive ad targeting and rate card pricing (premium audiences command higher CPMs).
- **First-party data:** Leverage subscriber data as first-party audience data for ad sales.
  Ensure consent management is in place before using subscriber data for advertising purposes.
- **Audience targeting:** Match ad space inventory to audience segments for campaign delivery.
  Use reach estimation to forecast available impressions per segment before proposal generation.
- **Reach estimation:** Calculate projected impressions based on historical delivery data,
  channel capacity, and audience overlap. Surface estimates in the proposal workflow.

## Content Operations
- **Content scheduling:** Use `ContentDistribution` to schedule content across channels with date/time slots.
  Respect channel-specific blackout windows and contractual exclusivity periods.
- **Distribution channels:** Model each distribution channel (linear TV, OTT, web, mobile, social) as a `MediaChannel`.
  Channel attributes drive content formatting requirements and delivery mechanisms.
- **Rights management:** Track content rights windows (start date, end date, territory, platform).
  Block scheduling outside rights windows — enforce via validation rules or Before Save flows.

## Integration Patterns
- **Ad server integration (Google Ad Manager, FreeWheel):**
  Use `AdServerIntegration` records to configure external ad server connections.
  Sync ad space availability, delivery reports, and campaign trafficking via scheduled Apex or Platform Events.
- **CRM to ad tech:** Push audience segments and campaign metadata to DSPs/SSPs via Named Credential callouts.
  Use Queueable Apex for bulk sync operations to respect governor limits.
- **CDN integration:** Content delivery metadata (URLs, thumbnails, manifests) syncs from CDN systems.
  Store CDN references — never store actual media files in Salesforce.

## Industries CPQ for Media
- Use Industries CPQ for media proposal generation and rate card pricing.
- Configure product catalog with media-specific attributes: channel, daypart, format, audience segment.
- Rate card rules drive automatic price calculation based on placement characteristics.
- Support package deals (multi-channel bundles) and value-added placements (bonus spots).
- Generate IOPs (Insertion Order Proposals) from approved media plans.

## Security
- **Subscriber PII:** Subscriber personal data is sensitive. Apply field-level encryption on PII fields.
  Use Shield Platform Encryption for subscriber email, phone, and address fields.
- **Content rights access control:** Restrict content rights data to authorized content operations teams.
  Use Permission Sets and sharing rules — never expose rights windows to advertiser portal users.
- **Partner portal sharing:** Advertisers and agencies access their own media plans via Experience Cloud.
  Configure sharing rules to scope visibility to owned records only. Use `with sharing` on all portal-facing Apex.

## Testing Media Cloud
- **Use TestDataFactory** to create media plans, ad spaces, and subscriber records in test setup.
- Create test factories for:
  - `MediaChannel` with associated `AdSpace` and `AdSpaceSpecification` records
  - `MediaPlan` with linked ad space allocations and rate card entries
  - `SubscriberProfile` with active `SubscriptionPlan` associations
  - `ContentDistribution` records with valid scheduling windows
- Test ad server integration with `Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, ...)` for external callouts.
- Validate subscriber lifecycle transitions with multiple test scenarios (trial→active, active→churned).
## Test Coverage Standards
- **Exactly one Assert per test method** using the modern `Assert` class.
- Use `@TestSetup` for shared test data; `System.runAs()` with Permission Set Group-based test users.
- Target **90% code coverage**.

## FLS & Data Access Enforcement
- **Always enforce FLS before DML using `Security.stripInaccessible()`.**
  - Before returning data to the UI: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.READABLE, records)`.
  - Before insert: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.CREATABLE, records)`.
  - Before update: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.UPDATABLE, records)`.
- Use `WITH USER_MODE` in SOQL to respect the running user's object and field permissions.
- Guard against SOQL injection: always use bind variables (`:variable`) in dynamic SOQL. Never concatenate user input.

## Documentation Standards
- Every `/docs/*.md` must start with the Salesforce Cloud logo header:
  `![Salesforce Cloud](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/691f4b0505409df23e191b87/69416b267de7ae6888996981_logo.svg)`
- Author: **Salesforce Professional Services**. Version: increment on significant changes.
- Always read existing docs before creating new ones — update rather than duplicate.

## Deployment
- Granular deploy: specific modified files/metadata ONLY.
- **Validate before deploying:** `sf project deploy validate -d force-app`.
- **Quick deploy only after successful validation:** `sf project deploy quick`.

## Semantic Commits
- Ask for **Backlog Item ID** before suggesting any commit.
- Format: `type(ID): short description`.
- Body: numbered list of changes + value proposition paragraph.

## Generated Prompts Registry (CRITICAL — do not skip)
- The project keeps `.generated-prompts/` at the repo root — one file per artifact type
  (`apex.md`, `lwc.md`, `flows.md`, `triggers.md`, `diagrams.md`, `cicd.md`, etc.).
- **Before creating any artifact:** read the corresponding register file if it exists.
  Use existing entries to infer naming conventions, patterns, data layer strategy,
  and design decisions already established in the project.
- **After creating or substantially changing an artifact:** write an entry immediately
  (same session — do not defer). Find the `## <ComponentName>` heading (or create it):
  increment **Iterations**, update **Updated**, replace **Prompt** with the refined prompt.
- Never stack versions — only the latest prompt lives in the entry.
- **Substantial change** = new method / new requirement / pattern change / refactor.
  Typos, formatting, and single-line corrections do NOT update the entry.

  Entry format:
  ```markdown
  ## <ComponentName>
  - **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Iterations:** N

  ### Key decisions
  - <pattern / constraint / design choice>

  ### Prompt
  ```
  <prompt summarized to key decisions if over 500 words>
  ```

- Media Cloud Overview: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.media_cloud_overview.htm

## Salesforce Reference Documentation
Prefer these official sources when researching platform behavior, APIs, or standards.

### Local Cache (check first)
- Before fetching any doc URL, check `.setup-agents/references/` for a cached copy.
  If a matching file exists there, read it locally instead of fetching the URL.
- Run `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs` to pre-populate the cache.

### Doc Retrieval Protocol
Salesforce docs come in three types — use the correct recovery method for each:

**Type 1 — Atlas-style** (URL pattern: `/docs/atlas.en-us.{guide}.meta/...`)
- 17 KB SPA shell, 0 HTML content. `get_document` API returns 0 bytes without auth.
- **Recovery: PDF only.** Use the PDF at `resources.docs.salesforce.com/latest/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/{name}.pdf`.

**Type 2 — New-style LWR** (URL pattern: `/docs/{product}/{guide}.html`)
- ~64 KB, partial SSR: `<h1>` + intro paragraphs + TOC. Full content loads via JS at runtime.
- **Recovery: WebFetch the URL for intro/TOC only.** For complete content use the corresponding PDF.

**Type 3 — Direct PDFs** (`resources.docs.salesforce.com/.../sfdc/pdf/*.pdf`)
- Full content, no JS. **Recovery: WebFetch the PDF URL directly.**

## Apex Trigger Handler Pattern (CRITICAL)
- One trigger per object. Zero logic in triggers — instantiate the controller and call `run()`.
- Trigger handlers extend the project's imported `TriggerHandler` base class (Kevin O'Hara framework)
  and act as **controllers**: they only invoke methods on Domain (`*Domain`) or Service (`*Service`) classes.
  NO business logic inside handler overrides.
- **Domain class**: encapsulates SObject-level rules and persistence.
- **Service class**: orchestrates multi-object operations, callouts, and mocks.

## Apex Complexity Rules
- **No nested loops.** Flatten with a `Map<Id, SObject>` keyed on the lookup field —
  inner lookups become O(1) map gets instead of O(n²) iteration.
- **if/else chains with 3+ branches on the same variable → `switch on`.**
  `switch on` supports String, Integer, Long, and sObject type. Reserve if/else for
  conditions that test different variables or complex boolean expressions.

## Apex Modern Patterns
- **`inherited sharing` on service and utility classes.** Classes invoked from both
  `with sharing` and `without sharing` callers must use `inherited sharing` so they
  respect the caller's context instead of silently elevating or dropping sharing.
- **Safe navigation `?.` (API 54+).** Replace multi-level null guards:
  `if (acc != null && acc.Contact != null)` → `acc?.Contact?.Name`.
- **`@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` cannot perform DML.** The platform blocks it at
  runtime — there is no compile-time error. Methods that insert/update/delete records
  must use `@AuraEnabled` (no `cacheable`).
- **Partial-success DML: `Database.insert(records, false)` + `SaveResult[]`.**
  Use instead of bare `insert records` when processing bulk inputs where some records
  may fail. Iterate `SaveResult` to log or surface individual errors.
- **`Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new MyMock())` for all callout tests.**
  Any test that exercises Apex with an HTTP callout requires an explicit mock —
  omitting it throws "Callout from Test not allowed" at runtime.

## LWC Modern Patterns (ES2024 / LWC v9)
- **Optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`** for wire data.
  Replace `data && data.records && data.records.length > 0` with
  `data?.records?.length > 0` and `value ?? defaultValue`.
- **`@track` is deprecated (API 46+).** All properties are reactive by default.
  Only add `@track` for deep mutations inside nested objects or arrays.
  Use a pure getter for derived/computed state — no `@track` state variable needed:
  `get sortedItems() { return [...(this.items ?? [])].sort(...); }`
- **`async/await` scope rules.** Valid in: event handlers, `@api` methods,
  `renderedCallback`. NOT valid in `connectedCallback` or `disconnectedCallback`
  (they are synchronous lifecycle hooks — use `.then()/.catch()` there).
- **Private class fields `#field` (API 59+ / LWC v9.1).** Prefer `#field` over
  `_field` with getter/setter boilerplate. Private methods (`#method()`) are also
  GA as of LWC v9.1.0 — use for internal helpers not exposed via `@api`.
- **`Object.groupBy()` (ES2024)** to group wire result arrays.
  Replace `records.reduce((acc, r) => { ... }, {})` with
  `Object.groupBy(records, r => r.Type__c)`.
- **`lwc:if` / `lwc:elseif` / `lwc:else` — `if:true` / `if:false` are deprecated.**
  Always use the directive form: `<template lwc:if={condition}>`. Remove any
  remaining `if:true` / `if:false` during refactors.
- **`<lwc:component lwc:is={ctor}>` replaces `lwc:dynamic`** (deprecated).
  Use for lazy-loaded or conditionally resolved component constructors.
- **`lwc:ref` for DOM queries in light DOM and slotted content.**
  Prefer `this.refs.myRef` over `this.template.querySelector()` when targeting
  elements in light DOM or across slot boundaries.
- **Signals (Beta — design awareness only).** LWC Signals provide granular
  reactivity without `@track`. Do NOT ship Signals code to production yet —
  wait for GA. Design new reactive state so it can migrate to Signals later
  (avoid deeply entangled `@track` chains).

## Architect Challenge Authority (CRITICAL)
> You are NOT a passive executor of Architect proposals. Evaluate the design in TWO passes before implementing anything.

### PASS 1 — Inherited Drift
Scan the Architect's recommendations and any `OBSERVATION:`-tagged decisions for this story. Evaluate each against:
1. **OOTB platform features** — does Salesforce already provide a native object, process, or setup page that covers ≥80% of the requirement?
2. **Existing project conventions** — does the proposal respect the PSet structure, naming patterns, and reusable classes already in the project?
3. **Simpler declarative alternatives** — Flow, Custom Metadata, Custom Label, Entitlements, Business Hours, Approval Process vs new Apex.
4. **Abstraction-wrapper anti-pattern** — is the proposal wrapping a single platform call in a new class/CMDT for no governor-limit reason?

Output `## Architectural Concerns (inherited)` listing each finding with:
- **(a)** Architect's proposal verbatim
- **(b)** The OOTB alternative or simpler pattern
- **(c)** The rationale citing at least one Salesforce platform reference

If no inherited drift found, output the section with "None identified."

### PASS 2 — Self-Scrutiny
Before finalising any implementation contract, scan your OWN proposed metadata additions against the same 4 criteria:
- Custom fields, picklists, CMDT records, Custom Labels, Permission Set entries, new Apex classes, new Flows

For each NEW metadata item you propose, write a one-line justification:
`<metadata API name>: <why this is needed> vs <OOTB platform feature or reuse target>`

If an OOTB feature covers the need → **drop the custom metadata from the proposal**.
If no OOTB feature covers it → state that explicitly with a citation.

Output `## Architectural Concerns (self-imposed)` — **always output this section, even if empty.**
**Never silently introduce custom metadata without this justification.**

## Interaction Preferences
- Concise, but detailed in Media Cloud configuration justifications.
- Correct mistakes directly without apologizing.

## Demand-Loaded Documentation (CONTRACT — cache-first, never raw WebFetch first)



Do not fetch these URLs by default, and do not reach for raw `WebFetch` as the first step.

When the task matches an activation signal, retrieve docs in this order:

1. Search the local reference cache first: `.setup-agents/references/` (the doc-retrieval skill).

   These cached `.md`/`.html` files are often very large (some exceed 5MB). **Use `Grep` with a

   specific search term to extract only the relevant section — NEVER `Read` a whole reference file;

   a full read of a multi-MB doc will blow the context window.** Read only the matched line ranges.

   When a referenced doc is a PDF or HTML file larger than ~256KB (the point a whole-file `Read`

   fails / blows the context window), do NOT `Read` it whole. First convert it with

   `sf setup-agents extract pdf-to-markdown --input <file> --out <file>.md` (or `html-to-markdown`),

   then `Grep` the resulting `.md` for the relevant section and read only the matched line ranges.

2. If the doc is missing from the cache, populate it with `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs`

   and grep the cached copy.

3. Only if the reference is genuinely not in the registry, fall back to `WebFetch` of the URL —

   and record the gap (the URL should be added to the refs registry).

If retrieval fails (network blocked, cache empty), say so explicitly and state which source you

actually used; never present cache-miss guesses as if they came from the official docs.
