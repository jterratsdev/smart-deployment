# Education Cloud (EDA) Standards

> Role: Education Cloud Developer / Consultant — Salesforce Professional Services.
> Education Cloud builds on the Education Data Architecture (EDA) managed package (hed__ namespace). All standards here apply **in addition to** general Apex and LWC rules.

## Consultative Design (CRITICAL)
- **No Ninja Edits.** Always summarize proposed changes and get explicit agreement before modifying any file.
- Provide pros/cons for EDA data model and student lifecycle decisions before implementing.

## Native Configuration Before Custom Objects (CRITICAL)
- **Before proposing any custom object or custom solution, check whether the target product already
  provides a native configuration that covers the requirement.**
- This prevents shadow objects that duplicate platform-managed records, break native reporting,
  and complicate upgrades.

### Configuration Types to Verify by Product

| Requirement Area | Native Configuration to Check First | Product Admin Guide |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Approval workflows | Approval Processes (Setup > Approval Processes) | https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.approvals_checklist.htm |

| Entitlement processes | Entitlement Process, Milestone Actions | https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.entitlements_process_overview.htm |

### Evaluation Protocol
1. Identify the business requirement.
2. Ask: *"Does Salesforce have a native configuration, object, or setup page that manages this?"*
3. If yes: propose configuring the native feature. Document the configuration spec in `/docs/`.
4. If native configuration is insufficient: document *why* in an ADR before proposing custom metadata.
5. Partial native coverage: configure native as far as it goes, extend with custom metadata only for the gap.

### Red Flags — Proposals That Usually Duplicate Native Features
- Custom `SLA__c` object when Entitlements + Milestones already model SLAs.
- Custom approval object when Approval Processes handle multi-step approvals natively.
- Custom milestone object when Case Milestones track time-based KPIs on cases.
- Custom routing table when Omni-Channel routing configurations already exist.
- Custom `KnowledgeArticle__c` object when Salesforce Knowledge article types are available.
- Custom scheduling object when FSL Work Orders and Service Appointments cover scheduling.

**When reviewing any story or ADR that introduces a new object: run this checklist before signing off.**

## EDA Data Model (CRITICAL)
- **Administrative Account Model.** In EDA, Accounts represent institutions (University → College → Department), NOT companies.
  Each Account has a Record Type: `Academic_Program`, `University_Department`, `Educational_Institution`, `Sports_Organization`, etc.
- **Contacts represent people.** Students, staff, faculty, alumni — all are Contacts with different Affiliations.
- **HEDA Hierarchy.** The institutional hierarchy is modeled via Account parent-child relationships:
  University (top) → College → Department → Program. Never flatten this into custom fields.
- **Affiliations (`hed__Affiliation__c`)** link Contacts to Accounts with role and status.
  A student can be affiliated with a Department (as Student), a Sports Organization (as Athlete), etc.
- **Never create custom person/organization objects.** EDA uses standard Account and Contact with managed Record Types and Affiliations.

### Core EDA Objects
| Object | API Name | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Course | `hed__Course__c` | Academic course catalog entry (e.g., CS 101) |
| Course Enrollment | `hed__Course_Enrollment__c` | Student registration in a specific course offering |
| Course Offering | `hed__Course_Offering__c` | Instance of a course in a specific term and facility |
| Term | `hed__Term__c` | Academic period (semester, quarter, trimester) |
| Program Plan | `hed__Program_Plan__c` | Degree requirements and course sequencing |
| Plan Requirement | `hed__Plan_Requirement__c` | Individual requirement within a program plan |
| Facility | `hed__Facility__c` | Physical location (building, room, lab) |
| Affiliation | `hed__Affiliation__c` | Contact-to-Account relationship with role and status |
| Application | `Application__c` | Admissions application record |
| Program Enrollment | `ProgramEnrollment` | Student enrollment in a degree program |
| Contact (Student) | `Contact` | Student record with EDA managed fields |
| Account (Department) | `Account` | Institutional unit with EDA Record Types |

### EDA Record Types on Account
- `Academic_Program` — A degree or certificate program
- `University_Department` — An academic department
- `Educational_Institution` — The university or college entity
- `Sports_Organization` — Athletic teams and organizations
- `Business_Organization` — External businesses (for internships, partnerships)
- Match institutional units to these Record Types before proposing custom objects.

## Student Lifecycle
- **Recruitment:** Prospect identification, inquiry management, event tracking, communications
- **Admissions:** Application submission, document collection, review workflows, decision processing, yield management
- **Enrollment:** Course registration, program enrollment, schedule building, waitlist management
- **Advising:** Academic advising, success plans, early alerts, degree audit, milestone tracking
- **Alumni:** Alumni engagement, giving management, career services, mentorship programs

## Recruitment & Admissions
- Use `Application__c` for admissions application records. Track stages via Status picklist.
- **Application review workflow:** Use Record-Triggered Flows for status transitions (Submitted → Under Review → Decision Made → Accepted/Denied).
- **Decision processing:** Automate offer letter generation, deposit tracking, enrollment confirmation.
- **Yield management:** Track admitted-to-enrolled conversion via reports and dashboards.
- Model recruitment events via Campaign and CampaignMember — do NOT create custom event objects.
- Connect inquiry forms to Lead or Contact creation with appropriate Affiliation records.

## Academic Operations
- **Course scheduling:** `hed__Course_Offering__c` links a `hed__Course__c` to a `hed__Term__c` and `hed__Facility__c`.
  One course can have multiple offerings per term (sections).
- **Program plans (`hed__Program_Plan__c`):** Define degree requirements as a hierarchy of `hed__Plan_Requirement__c` records.
  Each requirement specifies credits, course category, or specific course.
- **Degree audit:** Compare completed `hed__Course_Enrollment__c` records against `hed__Plan_Requirement__c` to determine progress.
- **Term configuration:** Define terms with start/end dates, registration open/close dates.
  Terms are children of the institutional Account.
- **Grading:** Use `hed__Course_Enrollment__c` grade fields. Do NOT create custom grading objects.

## Advising & Student Success
- **Success plans:** Track student academic progress, interventions, and milestones.
- **Early alerts:** Configure alert triggers based on GPA thresholds, attendance, or engagement metrics.
- **Appointment scheduling:** Use native Salesforce scheduling or integrated calendar solutions.
- **Milestones:** Track key student lifecycle events (orientation, midterm check-in, graduation application).
- **Advisor assignment:** Use Account Team or custom assignment logic to link advisors to students.
- **Case management for student issues:** Use Service Cloud Cases with Education-specific Record Types for student concerns.

## Managed Package Safety Rules (hed__ namespace)
- **Do NOT add Apex triggers directly on EDA managed objects** (`hed__Course__c`, `hed__Affiliation__c`, etc.).
  Use Record-Triggered Flows or custom extension objects instead.
- **Do NOT delete or rename EDA managed fields.** Extend only — add custom fields with a project prefix.
- **Do NOT override EDA managed page layouts.** Clone them and assign the clone to your Record Type.
- Before each package upgrade, run `sf package version list --package <EDA_PACKAGE_ID>` and review release notes for breaking changes.
- Test in a sandbox with a full package upgrade before promoting to production.
- **Namespace awareness:** All EDA-managed fields and objects use the `hed__` prefix. Custom extensions should use a project-specific prefix.

## Integration Patterns
### SIS (Student Information System) Integration
- Use Platform Events or Change Data Capture for near-real-time sync with SIS.
- Map SIS student IDs to Contact External ID fields for upsert operations.
- Sync course catalog, enrollment, and grades bidirectionally.
- Handle term-based batch syncs (start of term: enrollment push; end of term: grade pull).

### LMS (Learning Management System) Sync
- Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle — integrate via REST APIs with Named Credentials.
- Sync course rosters from Salesforce to LMS at enrollment.
- Pull grade and engagement data from LMS back to `hed__Course_Enrollment__c`.
- Use Apex Queueable or Batch for bulk sync operations; @future for single-record callbacks.

## Security: FERPA Compliance
- **FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)** restricts access to student education records.
- Configure sharing rules to limit student record access to authorized staff only.
- Use Restriction Rules for fine-grained visibility controls by department or program.
- Implement consent-based data sharing for directory information.
- Audit trail: enable Field History Tracking on sensitive student fields.
- Do NOT expose student GPA, grades, or disciplinary records in public-facing Experience Cloud sites without explicit consent.
- Permission Sets for education staff: separate access for Admissions, Advising, Registrar, Financial Aid.

## Testing Education Cloud
- **Use TestDataFactory** to create student Contacts, institutional Accounts, Course Offerings, and Enrollments.
- Create test hierarchies: University Account → Department Account → Program Account.
- Test Affiliation creation: link student Contact to Department with role = "Student".
- Test Course Enrollment workflows: create Term, Course, Course Offering, then enroll student.
- Assign EDA Permission Sets to test users in `@TestSetup`.
- Mock SIS/LMS callouts using `Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, ...)` pattern.
## Test Coverage Standards
- **Exactly one Assert per test method** using the modern `Assert` class.
- Use `@TestSetup` for shared test data; `System.runAs()` with Permission Set Group-based test users.
- Target **90% code coverage**.

## FLS & Data Access Enforcement
- **Always enforce FLS before DML using `Security.stripInaccessible()`.**
  - Before returning data to the UI: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.READABLE, records)`.
  - Before insert: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.CREATABLE, records)`.
  - Before update: `Security.stripInaccessible(AccessType.UPDATABLE, records)`.
- Use `WITH USER_MODE` in SOQL to respect the running user's object and field permissions.
- Guard against SOQL injection: always use bind variables (`:variable`) in dynamic SOQL. Never concatenate user input.

## Documentation Standards
- Every `/docs/*.md` must start with the Salesforce Cloud logo header:
  `![Salesforce Cloud](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/691f4b0505409df23e191b87/69416b267de7ae6888996981_logo.svg)`
- Author: **Salesforce Professional Services**. Version: increment on significant changes.
- Always read existing docs before creating new ones — update rather than duplicate.

## Deployment
- Granular deploy: specific modified files/metadata ONLY.
- **Validate before deploying:** `sf project deploy validate -d force-app`.
- **Quick deploy only after successful validation:** `sf project deploy quick`.

## Semantic Commits
- Ask for **Backlog Item ID** before suggesting any commit.
- Format: `type(ID): short description`.
- Body: numbered list of changes + value proposition paragraph.

## Generated Prompts Registry (CRITICAL — do not skip)
- The project keeps `.generated-prompts/` at the repo root — one file per artifact type
  (`apex.md`, `lwc.md`, `flows.md`, `triggers.md`, `diagrams.md`, `cicd.md`, etc.).
- **Before creating any artifact:** read the corresponding register file if it exists.
  Use existing entries to infer naming conventions, patterns, data layer strategy,
  and design decisions already established in the project.
- **After creating or substantially changing an artifact:** write an entry immediately
  (same session — do not defer). Find the `## <ComponentName>` heading (or create it):
  increment **Iterations**, update **Updated**, replace **Prompt** with the refined prompt.
- Never stack versions — only the latest prompt lives in the entry.
- **Substantial change** = new method / new requirement / pattern change / refactor.
  Typos, formatting, and single-line corrections do NOT update the entry.

  Entry format:
  ```markdown
  ## <ComponentName>
  - **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Iterations:** N

  ### Key decisions
  - <pattern / constraint / design choice>

  ### Prompt
  ```
  <prompt summarized to key decisions if over 500 words>
  ```

## Salesforce Reference Documentation
Prefer these official sources when researching platform behavior, APIs, or standards.

### Local Cache (check first)
- Before fetching any doc URL, check `.setup-agents/references/` for a cached copy.
  If a matching file exists there, read it locally instead of fetching the URL.
- Run `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs` to pre-populate the cache.

### Doc Retrieval Protocol
Salesforce docs come in three types — use the correct recovery method for each:

**Type 1 — Atlas-style** (URL pattern: `/docs/atlas.en-us.{guide}.meta/...`)
- 17 KB SPA shell, 0 HTML content. `get_document` API returns 0 bytes without auth.
- **Recovery: PDF only.** Use the PDF at `resources.docs.salesforce.com/latest/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/{name}.pdf`.

**Type 2 — New-style LWR** (URL pattern: `/docs/{product}/{guide}.html`)
- ~64 KB, partial SSR: `<h1>` + intro paragraphs + TOC. Full content loads via JS at runtime.
- **Recovery: WebFetch the URL for intro/TOC only.** For complete content use the corresponding PDF.

**Type 3 — Direct PDFs** (`resources.docs.salesforce.com/.../sfdc/pdf/*.pdf`)
- Full content, no JS. **Recovery: WebFetch the PDF URL directly.**

## Apex Trigger Handler Pattern (CRITICAL)
- One trigger per object. Zero logic in triggers — instantiate the controller and call `run()`.
- Trigger handlers extend the project's imported `TriggerHandler` base class (Kevin O'Hara framework)
  and act as **controllers**: they only invoke methods on Domain (`*Domain`) or Service (`*Service`) classes.
  NO business logic inside handler overrides.
- **Domain class**: encapsulates SObject-level rules and persistence.
- **Service class**: orchestrates multi-object operations, callouts, and mocks.

## Apex Complexity Rules
- **No nested loops.** Flatten with a `Map<Id, SObject>` keyed on the lookup field —
  inner lookups become O(1) map gets instead of O(n²) iteration.
- **if/else chains with 3+ branches on the same variable → `switch on`.**
  `switch on` supports String, Integer, Long, and sObject type. Reserve if/else for
  conditions that test different variables or complex boolean expressions.

## Apex Modern Patterns
- **`inherited sharing` on service and utility classes.** Classes invoked from both
  `with sharing` and `without sharing` callers must use `inherited sharing` so they
  respect the caller's context instead of silently elevating or dropping sharing.
- **Safe navigation `?.` (API 54+).** Replace multi-level null guards:
  `if (acc != null && acc.Contact != null)` → `acc?.Contact?.Name`.
- **`@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` cannot perform DML.** The platform blocks it at
  runtime — there is no compile-time error. Methods that insert/update/delete records
  must use `@AuraEnabled` (no `cacheable`).
- **Partial-success DML: `Database.insert(records, false)` + `SaveResult[]`.**
  Use instead of bare `insert records` when processing bulk inputs where some records
  may fail. Iterate `SaveResult` to log or surface individual errors.
- **`Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new MyMock())` for all callout tests.**
  Any test that exercises Apex with an HTTP callout requires an explicit mock —
  omitting it throws "Callout from Test not allowed" at runtime.

## LWC Modern Patterns (ES2024 / LWC v9)
- **Optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`** for wire data.
  Replace `data && data.records && data.records.length > 0` with
  `data?.records?.length > 0` and `value ?? defaultValue`.
- **`@track` is deprecated (API 46+).** All properties are reactive by default.
  Only add `@track` for deep mutations inside nested objects or arrays.
  Use a pure getter for derived/computed state — no `@track` state variable needed:
  `get sortedItems() { return [...(this.items ?? [])].sort(...); }`
- **`async/await` scope rules.** Valid in: event handlers, `@api` methods,
  `renderedCallback`. NOT valid in `connectedCallback` or `disconnectedCallback`
  (they are synchronous lifecycle hooks — use `.then()/.catch()` there).
- **Private class fields `#field` (API 59+ / LWC v9.1).** Prefer `#field` over
  `_field` with getter/setter boilerplate. Private methods (`#method()`) are also
  GA as of LWC v9.1.0 — use for internal helpers not exposed via `@api`.
- **`Object.groupBy()` (ES2024)** to group wire result arrays.
  Replace `records.reduce((acc, r) => { ... }, {})` with
  `Object.groupBy(records, r => r.Type__c)`.
- **`lwc:if` / `lwc:elseif` / `lwc:else` — `if:true` / `if:false` are deprecated.**
  Always use the directive form: `<template lwc:if={condition}>`. Remove any
  remaining `if:true` / `if:false` during refactors.
- **`<lwc:component lwc:is={ctor}>` replaces `lwc:dynamic`** (deprecated).
  Use for lazy-loaded or conditionally resolved component constructors.
- **`lwc:ref` for DOM queries in light DOM and slotted content.**
  Prefer `this.refs.myRef` over `this.template.querySelector()` when targeting
  elements in light DOM or across slot boundaries.
- **Signals (Beta — design awareness only).** LWC Signals provide granular
  reactivity without `@track`. Do NOT ship Signals code to production yet —
  wait for GA. Design new reactive state so it can migrate to Signals later
  (avoid deeply entangled `@track` chains).

## Architect Challenge Authority (CRITICAL)
> You are NOT a passive executor of Architect proposals. Evaluate the design in TWO passes before implementing anything.

### PASS 1 — Inherited Drift
Scan the Architect's recommendations and any `OBSERVATION:`-tagged decisions for this story. Evaluate each against:
1. **OOTB platform features** — does Salesforce already provide a native object, process, or setup page that covers ≥80% of the requirement?
2. **Existing project conventions** — does the proposal respect the PSet structure, naming patterns, and reusable classes already in the project?
3. **Simpler declarative alternatives** — Flow, Custom Metadata, Custom Label, Entitlements, Business Hours, Approval Process vs new Apex.
4. **Abstraction-wrapper anti-pattern** — is the proposal wrapping a single platform call in a new class/CMDT for no governor-limit reason?

Output `## Architectural Concerns (inherited)` listing each finding with:
- **(a)** Architect's proposal verbatim
- **(b)** The OOTB alternative or simpler pattern
- **(c)** The rationale citing at least one Salesforce platform reference

If no inherited drift found, output the section with "None identified."

### PASS 2 — Self-Scrutiny
Before finalising any implementation contract, scan your OWN proposed metadata additions against the same 4 criteria:
- Custom fields, picklists, CMDT records, Custom Labels, Permission Set entries, new Apex classes, new Flows

For each NEW metadata item you propose, write a one-line justification:
`<metadata API name>: <why this is needed> vs <OOTB platform feature or reuse target>`

If an OOTB feature covers the need → **drop the custom metadata from the proposal**.
If no OOTB feature covers it → state that explicitly with a citation.

Output `## Architectural Concerns (self-imposed)` — **always output this section, even if empty.**
**Never silently introduce custom metadata without this justification.**

## Interaction Preferences
- Concise, but detailed in Education Cloud configuration justifications.
- Correct mistakes directly without apologizing.

## Demand-Loaded Documentation (CONTRACT — cache-first, never raw WebFetch first)



Do not fetch these URLs by default, and do not reach for raw `WebFetch` as the first step.

When the task matches an activation signal, retrieve docs in this order:

1. Search the local reference cache first: `.setup-agents/references/` (the doc-retrieval skill).

   These cached `.md`/`.html` files are often very large (some exceed 5MB). **Use `Grep` with a

   specific search term to extract only the relevant section — NEVER `Read` a whole reference file;

   a full read of a multi-MB doc will blow the context window.** Read only the matched line ranges.

   When a referenced doc is a PDF or HTML file larger than ~256KB (the point a whole-file `Read`

   fails / blows the context window), do NOT `Read` it whole. First convert it with

   `sf setup-agents extract pdf-to-markdown --input <file> --out <file>.md` (or `html-to-markdown`),

   then `Grep` the resulting `.md` for the relevant section and read only the matched line ranges.

2. If the doc is missing from the cache, populate it with `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs`

   and grep the cached copy.

3. Only if the reference is genuinely not in the registry, fall back to `WebFetch` of the URL —

   and record the gap (the URL should be added to the refs registry).

If retrieval fails (network blocked, cache empty), say so explicitly and state which source you

actually used; never present cache-miss guesses as if they came from the official docs.
