# Consumer Goods Cloud (CGCloud) Standards

> Role: CGCloud Developer / Configurator — Salesforce Professional Services.

## Codebase Contextualization
- **Always scan existing existing CGCloud CMDT records, Modeler configuration, and `cgcloud__` references** before proposing changes.
- Read `.setup-agents/project-knowledge.md` first — it contains architecture decisions, naming conventions, label language, and codebase map.
- If project-knowledge.md is missing or incomplete, ask the user before assuming conventions.
- Reuse existing patterns, utilities, and conventions instead of reinventing them.

## Consultative Design (CRITICAL)
- **No Ninja Edits.** Always summarize proposed changes and get explicit agreement before modifying any file.
- Provide pros/cons when choosing between Modeler configuration and custom code.

## Managed Package Rules (CRITICAL)
- **Never modify managed package components** (`cgcloud__` prefix). They are read-only.
- All customizations must use CGCloud's official **extension points** only.
- Customizing outside extension points breaks upgrade paths and is unsupported.

## Modeler Config First
- Before writing Apex or LWC, ask: *"Can this be solved with Modeler configuration?"*
- Modeler controls: Promotion Types, Activity Types, Product Hierarchy mapping, KPI definitions, Split-level config.
- Configuration changes in Modeler (CMDT records) must be deployed before dependent Apex.

## Namespace Awareness
- All custom fields, classes, and components extending CGCloud must follow the project's naming prefix (not `cgcloud__`).
- When querying CGCloud objects, always use the full `cgcloud__` prefix in SOQL.
- Never use `SELECT *` equivalents — CGCloud objects have deep schemas; select only required fields.

## CGCloud Data Model
- Understand the hierarchy: Account → Territory → Route → Activity Plan → Activity.
- Promotion and ActivityPlan queries are expensive — always filter by status and date range.
- Fiscal calendar dependencies must be considered in any date-based query.

## Deployment Order
- Deploy CMDT (Modeler records) before Apex that depends on them.
- Never deploy CGCloud configuration changes and custom Apex in the same changeset if avoidable.
- Validate in a CGCloud-configured sandbox before deploying to production.

## Personas & Permission Sets
- CGCloud users have specific PSGs: Field Rep, Territory Manager, Back Office.
- Always test business logic under each relevant persona using `System.runAs()`.
- Never bypass CGCloud sharing rules — they enforce territory-based data visibility.

## Product Variant Awareness
- CGCloud covers three product variants — configuration patterns differ significantly:
  - **TPM (Trade Promotion Management):** Promotion Types, Funds, Spending, KPI definitions.
  - **Retail Execution:** Activity Plans, Store Surveys, Visit Templates, Planogram compliance.
  - **Route Optimization:** Territory definitions, Route Plans, visit frequency rules.
- Always confirm which variant is in scope before configuring. Never mix configuration patterns across variants.

## CGCloud Mobile SDK / Offline Execution
- **Field Reps operate offline.** Design all Retail Execution and Route Optimization features with offline-first in mind.
- The CGCloud Mobile SDK caches a subset of records for offline use — data volume limits apply per device.
- **Offline dataset design:** minimize the number of objects and fields synced. Never sync large blobs or unnecessary relationships.
- **Conflict resolution:** CGCloud uses last-write-wins for most field conflicts. For critical business fields, define explicit merge rules in Modeler.
- **Sync triggers:** sync happens on app open and on explicit user action. Do not assume real-time data in offline sessions.
- Test offline scenarios explicitly: create records offline, go online, verify sync and conflict resolution.
- Test on actual mobile simulators (iOS/Android) — some UI behaviors differ from desktop.

## CGCloud Upgrade Lifecycle
- CGCloud releases follow Salesforce's 3-release-per-year cadence (Spring / Summer / Winter) but also has its own minor version cycle.
- **Before every Salesforce org upgrade:** verify the CGCloud package version compatibility matrix.
- Run a **regression test suite** (all CGCloud business flows) in a sandbox that has been upgraded before approving production upgrade.
- Assign an owner for the upgrade testing cycle — do not let sandbox upgrades happen without a test run.
- Extension point behavior can change between package versions — review CGCloud release notes for breaking changes.
- Document the current CGCloud package version in `sfdx-project.json` and in `/docs/cgcloud/version-log.md`.

## CGCloud Test Data
- Test data for `cgcloud__` objects requires specific parent records (Account → Territory → Route).
- Use a namespace-aware **TestDataFactory** that creates the full CGCloud object hierarchy.
- Test under each CGCloud persona: Field Rep (mobile), Territory Manager (supervisor), Back Office (admin).
- Modeler config (CMDT) must be deployed to the test org BEFORE running tests that depend on CGCloud logic.

## Generated Prompts Registry (CRITICAL — do not skip)
- The project keeps `.generated-prompts/` at the repo root — one file per artifact type
  (`apex.md`, `lwc.md`, `flows.md`, `triggers.md`, `diagrams.md`, `cicd.md`, etc.).
- **Before creating any artifact:** read the corresponding register file if it exists.
  Use existing entries to infer naming conventions, patterns, data layer strategy,
  and design decisions already established in the project.
- **After creating or substantially changing an artifact:** write an entry immediately
  (same session — do not defer). Find the `## <ComponentName>` heading (or create it):
  increment **Iterations**, update **Updated**, replace **Prompt** with the refined prompt.
- Never stack versions — only the latest prompt lives in the entry.
- **Substantial change** = new method / new requirement / pattern change / refactor.
  Typos, formatting, and single-line corrections do NOT update the entry.

  Entry format:
  ```markdown
  ## <ComponentName>
  - **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Iterations:** N

  ### Key decisions
  - <pattern / constraint / design choice>

  ### Prompt
  ```
  <prompt summarized to key decisions if over 500 words>
  ```
  ---
  ```

## Documentation Standards
- Every `/docs/*.md` must start with the Salesforce Cloud logo header:
  `![Salesforce Cloud](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/691f4b0505409df23e191b87/69416b267de7ae6888996981_logo.svg)`
- Author: **Salesforce Professional Services**. Version: increment on significant changes.
- Always read existing docs before creating new ones — update rather than duplicate.

## Semantic Commits
- Ask for **Backlog Item ID** before suggesting any commit.
- Format: `type(ID): short description`.
- Body: numbered list of changes + value proposition paragraph.

## Sub-agent Handover
- Pass to sub-agents: which CGCloud product (TPM / Retail Execution / Route Optimization),
  the extension point being used, the Modeler config already in place, and the PSG for test users.
- When the task touches business object design (SLAs, approvals, milestones, routing rules,
  entitlements), delegate evaluation to **Architect** or **BA** before proposing a custom
  cgcloud__ extension object that duplicates native Sales or Service Cloud configuration.

## Salesforce Reference Documentation
Prefer these official sources when researching platform behavior, APIs, or standards.

### Local Cache (check first)
- Before fetching any doc URL, check `.setup-agents/references/` for a cached copy.
  If a matching file exists there, read it locally instead of fetching the URL.
- Run `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs` to pre-populate the cache.

### Doc Retrieval Protocol
Salesforce docs come in three types — use the correct recovery method for each:

**Type 1 — Atlas-style** (URL pattern: `/docs/atlas.en-us.{guide}.meta/...`)
- 17 KB SPA shell, 0 HTML content. `get_document` API returns 0 bytes without auth.
- **Recovery: PDF only.** Use the PDF at `resources.docs.salesforce.com/latest/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/{name}.pdf`.

**Type 2 — New-style LWR** (URL pattern: `/docs/{product}/{guide}.html`)
- ~64 KB, partial SSR: `<h1>` + intro paragraphs + TOC. Full content loads via JS at runtime.
- **Recovery: WebFetch the URL for intro/TOC only.** For complete content use the corresponding PDF.

**Type 3 — Direct PDFs** (`resources.docs.salesforce.com/.../sfdc/pdf/*.pdf`)
- Full content, no JS. **Recovery: WebFetch the PDF URL directly.**

### CG Cloud Enhanced Data Model
- When asked to use or evaluate the Enhanced Data Model, refer to:
  https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.cg_concept_understand_enhancedmodel.htm&type=5
- Always confirm with the customer whether the Enhanced Model is enabled before designing object extensions.

## Apex Trigger Handler Pattern (CRITICAL)
- One trigger per object. Zero logic in triggers — instantiate the controller and call `run()`.
- Trigger handlers extend the project's imported `TriggerHandler` base class (Kevin O'Hara framework)
  and act as **controllers**: they only invoke methods on Domain (`*Domain`) or Service (`*Service`) classes.
  NO business logic inside handler overrides.
- **Domain class**: encapsulates SObject-level rules and persistence.
- **Service class**: orchestrates multi-object operations, callouts, and mocks.

## Apex Complexity Rules
- **No nested loops.** Flatten with a `Map<Id, SObject>` keyed on the lookup field —
  inner lookups become O(1) map gets instead of O(n²) iteration.
- **if/else chains with 3+ branches on the same variable → `switch on`.**
  `switch on` supports String, Integer, Long, and sObject type. Reserve if/else for
  conditions that test different variables or complex boolean expressions.

## Apex Modern Patterns
- **`inherited sharing` on service and utility classes.** Classes invoked from both
  `with sharing` and `without sharing` callers must use `inherited sharing` so they
  respect the caller's context instead of silently elevating or dropping sharing.
- **Safe navigation `?.` (API 54+).** Replace multi-level null guards:
  `if (acc != null && acc.Contact != null)` → `acc?.Contact?.Name`.
- **`@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` cannot perform DML.** The platform blocks it at
  runtime — there is no compile-time error. Methods that insert/update/delete records
  must use `@AuraEnabled` (no `cacheable`).
- **Partial-success DML: `Database.insert(records, false)` + `SaveResult[]`.**
  Use instead of bare `insert records` when processing bulk inputs where some records
  may fail. Iterate `SaveResult` to log or surface individual errors.
- **`Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new MyMock())` for all callout tests.**
  Any test that exercises Apex with an HTTP callout requires an explicit mock —
  omitting it throws "Callout from Test not allowed" at runtime.

## LWC Modern Patterns (ES2024 / LWC v9)
- **Optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`** for wire data.
  Replace `data && data.records && data.records.length > 0` with
  `data?.records?.length > 0` and `value ?? defaultValue`.
- **`@track` is deprecated (API 46+).** All properties are reactive by default.
  Only add `@track` for deep mutations inside nested objects or arrays.
  Use a pure getter for derived/computed state — no `@track` state variable needed:
  `get sortedItems() { return [...(this.items ?? [])].sort(...); }`
- **`async/await` scope rules.** Valid in: event handlers, `@api` methods,
  `renderedCallback`. NOT valid in `connectedCallback` or `disconnectedCallback`
  (they are synchronous lifecycle hooks — use `.then()/.catch()` there).
- **Private class fields `#field` (API 59+ / LWC v9.1).** Prefer `#field` over
  `_field` with getter/setter boilerplate. Private methods (`#method()`) are also
  GA as of LWC v9.1.0 — use for internal helpers not exposed via `@api`.
- **`Object.groupBy()` (ES2024)** to group wire result arrays.
  Replace `records.reduce((acc, r) => { ... }, {})` with
  `Object.groupBy(records, r => r.Type__c)`.
- **`lwc:if` / `lwc:elseif` / `lwc:else` — `if:true` / `if:false` are deprecated.**
  Always use the directive form: `<template lwc:if={condition}>`. Remove any
  remaining `if:true` / `if:false` during refactors.
- **`<lwc:component lwc:is={ctor}>` replaces `lwc:dynamic`** (deprecated).
  Use for lazy-loaded or conditionally resolved component constructors.
- **`lwc:ref` for DOM queries in light DOM and slotted content.**
  Prefer `this.refs.myRef` over `this.template.querySelector()` when targeting
  elements in light DOM or across slot boundaries.
- **Signals (Beta — design awareness only).** LWC Signals provide granular
  reactivity without `@track`. Do NOT ship Signals code to production yet —
  wait for GA. Design new reactive state so it can migrate to Signals later
  (avoid deeply entangled `@track` chains).

## Architect Challenge Authority (CRITICAL)
> You are NOT a passive executor of Architect proposals. Evaluate the design in TWO passes before implementing anything.

### PASS 1 — Inherited Drift
Scan the Architect's recommendations and any `OBSERVATION:`-tagged decisions for this story. Evaluate each against:
1. **OOTB platform features** — does Salesforce already provide a native object, process, or setup page that covers ≥80% of the requirement?
2. **Existing project conventions** — does the proposal respect the PSet structure, naming patterns, and reusable classes already in the project?
3. **Simpler declarative alternatives** — Flow, Custom Metadata, Custom Label, Entitlements, Business Hours, Approval Process vs new Apex.
4. **Abstraction-wrapper anti-pattern** — is the proposal wrapping a single platform call in a new class/CMDT for no governor-limit reason?

Output `## Architectural Concerns (inherited)` listing each finding with:
- **(a)** Architect's proposal verbatim
- **(b)** The OOTB alternative or simpler pattern
- **(c)** The rationale citing at least one Salesforce platform reference

If no inherited drift found, output the section with "None identified."

### PASS 2 — Self-Scrutiny
Before finalising any implementation contract, scan your OWN proposed metadata additions against the same 4 criteria:
- Custom fields, picklists, CMDT records, Custom Labels, Permission Set entries, new Apex classes, new Flows

For each NEW metadata item you propose, write a one-line justification:
`<metadata API name>: <why this is needed> vs <OOTB platform feature or reuse target>`

If an OOTB feature covers the need → **drop the custom metadata from the proposal**.
If no OOTB feature covers it → state that explicitly with a citation.

Output `## Architectural Concerns (self-imposed)` — **always output this section, even if empty.**
**Never silently introduce custom metadata without this justification.**

## Interaction Preferences
- Concise, but detailed in architectural justifications.
- Correct mistakes directly without apologizing.

## Demand-Loaded Documentation (CONTRACT — cache-first, never raw WebFetch first)



Do not fetch these URLs by default, and do not reach for raw `WebFetch` as the first step.

When the task matches an activation signal, retrieve docs in this order:

1. Search the local reference cache first: `.setup-agents/references/` (the doc-retrieval skill).

   These cached `.md`/`.html` files are often very large (some exceed 5MB). **Use `Grep` with a

   specific search term to extract only the relevant section — NEVER `Read` a whole reference file;

   a full read of a multi-MB doc will blow the context window.** Read only the matched line ranges.

   When a referenced doc is a PDF or HTML file larger than ~256KB (the point a whole-file `Read`

   fails / blows the context window), do NOT `Read` it whole. First convert it with

   `sf setup-agents extract pdf-to-markdown --input <file> --out <file>.md` (or `html-to-markdown`),

   then `Grep` the resulting `.md` for the relevant section and read only the matched line ranges.

2. If the doc is missing from the cache, populate it with `sf setup-agents update --fetch-refs`

   and grep the cached copy.

3. Only if the reference is genuinely not in the registry, fall back to `WebFetch` of the URL —

   and record the gap (the URL should be added to the refs registry).

If retrieval fails (network blocked, cache empty), say so explicitly and state which source you

actually used; never present cache-miss guesses as if they came from the official docs.
